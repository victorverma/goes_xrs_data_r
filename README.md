# `code/download_raw_data.sh`

This script saves raw data files in `raw/`; it should be run from `code/`. The URLs for the raw data files were found by following links from [this page](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/satellite/goes-r.html), which links to
repositories of science-quality data. The links to follow are those for the
"1-minute Averages" product for the XRS instrument. [This Readme](https://data.ngdc.noaa.gov/platforms/solar-space-observing-satellites/goes/goes16/l1b/docs/GOES-R_EXIS_XRS_L1b_Data_ReadMe.pdf) recommends using science-quality L2 data instead of science-quality L1b data.
